I had origionally recorded these manipulated URLs in the Email-Username repository however as it has grown I have now decided to create a separate repository. If you have any that you would like adding pass them on to me.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Examples of Manipulated URLs</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Bear in mind that from time to time websites may change their URL structure, in case some of the below do not work and I have not had time to update the below. You can always DM me on Twitter if one is not working</p>
